# Automatic Light Control Using LDR

This project is a simple and practical automatic lighting system that turns a lamp or light on/off based on ambient light levels using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor). It includes both analog and microcontroller (Arduino) implementations, with full Proteus simulation and PCB layout using EasyEDA.

## üîß Features

- Automatic control of a light based on surrounding brightness
- Two versions:
  - Analog circuit using transistor and relay
  - Arduino-based version using analogRead + digitalWrite
- Proteus simulation for both versions
- PCB design using EasyEDA
- Cost-effective and beginner-friendly

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Analog Version**:  
  Uses a voltage divider with LDR. When light is low, voltage across base of the transistor increases, activating the relay to turn on the light.

- **Arduino Version**:  
  LDR is connected to an analog input. Arduino reads light level and controls output pin connected to a relay or LED.
